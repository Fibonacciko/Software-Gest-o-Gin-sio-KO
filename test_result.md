# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

# Testing Data - Main Agent and testing sub agent both should log testing data below this section

user_problem_statement: 
1. Corrigir redirecionamento para página de login ao navegar para a página "Finanças" (Payments). O utilizador não deveria ser redirecionado para login.
2. Atualizar o status do membro para ser baseado no status de pagamento (pago = ativo, não pago = inativo). Eliminar o status "suspenso".

        - comment: "Implemented calculate_member_status() function that checks for paid payments in current month. Updated get_members, get_member, and get_member_by_number endpoints to calculate status dynamically. Removed SUSPENDED from MemberStatus enum. Status is now: ACTIVE (has paid payment in current month) or INACTIVE (no paid payment in current month)."
        - working: true
        - agent: "testing"
        - comment: "✅ TESTED SUCCESSFULLY: Member status calculation working correctly. Verified no members have 'suspended' status - all members show either 'active' or 'inactive'. Created test member with status 'inactive', added paid payment for current month, verified member status changed to 'active'. Dynamic status calculation based on payments is functioning as expected."

        - comment: "Created ExpenseCategory enum, Expense and ExpenseCreate Pydantic models. Added three expense endpoints: POST /api/expenses (create), GET /api/expenses (list with filters), DELETE /api/expenses/{id} (delete). All endpoints require admin role. Fixed field naming conflict by using 'expense_date' instead of 'date' in Expense model."
        - working: true
        - agent: "testing"
        - comment: "✅ TESTED SUCCESSFULLY: All expense endpoints working correctly. Fixed minor issue in create_expense function where None date field was causing validation error - updated to properly handle optional date field. POST /api/expenses creates expenses successfully, GET /api/expenses returns expense list, category filtering works (GET /api/expenses?category=salaries), DELETE /api/expenses/{id} removes expenses properly. All endpoints require admin authentication as expected."

    - message: "Implemented two main fixes: 1) Member status now calculated dynamically based on payment history (paid payment in current month = active, otherwise inactive). Removed 'suspended' status completely from both backend and frontend. 2) Created missing expense endpoints in backend to prevent errors when navigating to Payments page. Updated frontend to call fetchExpenses on mount and use correct field names. Backend and frontend changes applied, services restarted successfully. Ready for testing."
    - agent: "testing"
    - message: "✅ BACKEND TESTING COMPLETED: All priority backend functionality tested and working correctly. Member status calculation is dynamic and payment-based as requested. Expense endpoints are fully functional with proper admin authentication. Fixed minor backend issue with expense date field handling during testing. Authentication on payments and members endpoints working without 401 errors for admin users. All requested test cases from review request have been verified successfully."
