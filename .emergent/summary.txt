The AI engineer's work on the gym management system has been iterative, addressing numerous user requests for feature enhancements, UI/UX improvements, and bug fixes. Key areas of development included a major overhaul of the Reports section, branding updates, and the implementation of a dynamic dark mode. Significant effort was dedicated to integrating and later simplifying advanced backend technologies like GraphQL, Redis, and WebSockets for deployment readiness. The trajectory shows persistent debugging of frontend-backend communication, particularly concerning navigation issues and data consistency after modifications. Recent tasks involved fixing calendar displays, refining payment/inventory page designs, and meticulously cleaning up unused backend dependencies. The current challenge revolves around a persistent payment registration failure, despite backend successes, and the user has requested a financial data reset endpoint.

<product_requirements>
The user, a Portuguese gym owner, requires a bilingual web-based management panel with core functionalities: detailed membership management (CRUD, attendance), comprehensive payment/subscription support (plans, finance reports, admin access), and an administration panel (manual check-in, stock, user roles). Implemented features include staff management, an advanced dashboard with member details and attendance calendar, Finanças (payments) and Gestão de Stock (inventory) pages with refined designs and role-based access. The Reports page was overhauled with detailed financial, member, and stock analytics using . Branding was updated to Ginásio KO with a new logo. A dynamic dark mode was added, later adjusted for clarity and color tone. Member management gained improved filters and photo upload. Attendance calculation was corrected, and the Calendário page was removed. Payments now support specific statuses (Pago/Pendente), modality filters, recent-to-oldest sorting, individual deletion, and optional payment date modification.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on resolving a critical issue: the inability to register payments in either the development or production environments. Earlier troubleshooting revealed that the backend  endpoint was functioning correctly when tested directly via , implying a frontend or environment configuration problem. The engineer had also correctly identified and fixed the  in , which was pointing to an incorrect preview domain in production, and adjusted the payment creation endpoint's authorization from  to .

However, the user continued to report payment registration failures in production, where the Guardar (Save) button in the payment dialog would do nothing. The engineer also addressed user requests to ensure Pagamentos Recentes are ordered by date (newest to oldest) in the frontend and backend, and to add a delete button for payments (which required creating a new  endpoint in the backend). Separately, the user requested an admin endpoint to reset financial data, and the engineer had just started implementing this  endpoint in . The focus is split between addressing the payment registration bug and developing the requested reset endpoint.
