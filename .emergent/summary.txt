The trajectory details the development of a full-stack gym management system, starting with an MVP and expanding into a feature-rich, premium application. Initially, the AI engineer clarified deployment concerns regarding a 10-minute time limit for preview environments. The core development then focused on a new mobile app with QR code check-in, push notifications, and motivational notes. This involved significant backend expansion in  to support these features and integrate Firebase.

Subsequently, a major design overhaul was undertaken to integrate the gym's logo colors (soft orange/amber) into the frontend, updating , , , and  with dynamic backgrounds and harmonious gradients. The project then shifted to implementing premium features across the backend (analytics, rate limiting, structured logging, caching) and frontend (PWA, keyboard shortcuts, command palette, dark mode). Debugging involved fixing bare  statements, JSX compilation errors, and date serialization issues. The current state is that the backend and much of the frontend premium features are implemented, but the user is confused about the correct URL to test the progress.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on transforming the frontend into a Premium application, having just implemented Dark Mode functionality. This involved:
1.  **Backend Premium Features**: Integrating structured logging (), caching ( with in-memory fallback), rate limiting (), and an analytics engine into  via new utility modules (, , , ). Dashboard analytics, member analytics, and churn analysis endpoints were added. Date serialization issues with MongoDB and a login endpoint bug were identified and fixed.
2.  **PWA (Progressive Web App)**: Creating  and  for offline capabilities, and integrating a  component into . This also involved creating  and  for enhanced navigation. Several JSX compilation errors in  were debugged and resolved during this phase.
3.  **Dark Mode Premium**: Implementing a dark mode using , , and . This functionality was integrated into  and , with a keyboard shortcut () added for toggling.
