The AI engineer successfully built out significant portions of a gym management system, transforming it from an initial MVP to a feature-rich application. Key development phases included reactivating and debugging user management, enhancing the dashboard with detailed member check-in panels, refining member attendance and payment/finance pages, and developing a comprehensive inventory management system. A major challenge throughout was debugging frontend-backend integration, particularly with authentication, and persistent regressions in the quick check-in functionality, often requiring intervention from the troubleshoot agent. The engineer diligently addressed user feedback for UI/UX improvements, introduced dynamic financial reporting, and implemented role-based access logic. The trajectory concludes with the successful overhaul of the Reports page to include robust financial, member, and stock reporting with graphical representations and flexible date ranges.

The user, a Portuguese gym owner, required a bilingual web-based backend management panel. Core functionalities included detailed membership management (profiles, CRUD, attendance tracking, member numbers), comprehensive payment/subscription support (monthly/annual plans, finance reports, Mbway, admin access), and an administration panel (manual check-in, member details, merchandise stock, announcements, user roles). Subsequent requests refined these: Admin/Staff logins (Admin creates/deactivates staff), specific activity modalities for check-in with visual indicators, automatic member numbering, and MBWay payment integration. The AI engineer implemented staff account management, an advanced dashboard with member check-in details (editable notes, clinical record, visual attendance calendar), redesigned the Payments page to Finanças with expense tracking and role-based views, overhauled Gestão de Stock with sales and admin-specific financial insights, and refactored the Reports page with financial, member, and stock analytics, incorporating charts and flexible date ranges.
