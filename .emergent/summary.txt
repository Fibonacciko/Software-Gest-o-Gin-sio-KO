The previous AI engineer successfully developed a comprehensive gym management system from scratch based on the user's requests. The development followed a phased approach, starting with core membership and UI, then integrating robust authentication, activity tracking, automatic member numbering, and new payment methods. Key challenges included debugging backend and frontend integration issues, particularly with authentication libraries (bcrypt) and MongoDB connectivity, and ensuring proper UI rendering. The engineer meticulously addressed user feedback, integrated new features incrementally, and utilized a testing agent to validate functionality and fix bugs. The trajectory concludes with the user requesting to reactivate and refine the staff account management, which was an existing but incomplete feature.

<product_requirements>
The user, a gym owner in Portugal, requested a web-based backend management panel (bilingual EN/PT) to optimize business operations.

Initial requirements:
1.  **Membership Management**:
    *   Member profiles (name, DOB, nationality, profession, address, contact).
    *   Full member database with add/edit/delete/filter capabilities.
    *   Membership types and status tracking.
    *   Attendance tracking via a monthly calendar with a yellow checkmark for presence (manual or QR code).
    *   Ability for members to purchase, cancel, or renew memberships.
2.  **Payments & Subscriptions**:
    *   Support for monthly and annual plans.
    *   Finance reports (income/expenses by month/year/type) and member attendance reports.
    *   Integration with debit card and Mbway.
    *   Reminders for expiration/renewal.
    *   Admin access to payment history and invoices.
3.  **Administration Panel**:
    *   Home page with manual check-in.
    *   Post check-in: Member details page (photo, name, calendar/attendance, status, textbox).
    *   Management of members, payments (manual subscriptions/discounts), finances.
    *   View reports: income, expenses, member activities, attendance.
    *   Send announcements.
    *   Merchandise stock management (sports clothing and equipment).

Clarifications and subsequent requests:
*   Initial focus on manual payments (cash only). QR code for future mobile app. Reminders also for future mobile/SMS. Manual member registration initially.
*   Ability for different logins: Admin (full access) and Staff (all except finance). Admin can create/deactivate staff accounts.
*   Track specific modalities (activities) during check-in (Boxe, Kickboxing, Jiu-Jitsu, CrossFit, Musculação, Pilates, Yoga, Dança), with visual indication on the member's attendance calendar and modality-specific reports.
*   Automatic member numbers for identification and check-in (by name, number, or QR code).
*   Add MBWay as a payment method.
*   General bug fixing and system verification.

Extensive modifications for JWT authentication, user roles (Admin/Staff), endpoints for user management, QR code generation, activity/modality models, member number generation, and MBWay payment. Debugging involved fixing endpoint routes, password hashing (bcrypt to SHA256/MD5 temporarily), and ensuring correct MongoDB database usage. Includes startup logic to create default modalities and assign member numbers.
*   **/app/backend/.env**: Environment variables for backend.
    *   **Importance**: Stores sensitive configuration like , , and .
    *   **Changes**:  was explicitly set to test_database (from an earlier default gym_management) during authentication debugging.
*   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: Main React application component.
    *   **Importance**: Handles global routing, context providers, and overall application layout.
    *   **Changes**: Integrated  for authentication, added  for secured routes, defined routes for Login, Dashboard, Members, etc. Temporarily commented out  route during debugging to isolate issues.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the user asked: Seria importante criar no painel do admin a possibilidade de criar contas de staff e definir palavras secretas. (It would be important to create in the admin panel the possibility to create staff accounts and define secret passwords.)

The AI engineer's last action was acknowledging this request: Excelente ideia! Vou reativar e corrigir a página de gestão de utilizadores que já tinha implementado. Ela permite ao admin criar contas de staff e definir passwords. (Excellent idea! I will reactivate and fix the user management page that I had already implemented. It allows the admin to create staff accounts and define passwords.)

This means the current work involves:
1.  **Reactivating the  page** in the frontend, which was temporarily commented out in  during previous authentication debugging.
2.  **Ensuring the associated backend endpoints** for user creation, editing, and deactivation are fully functional and correctly integrate with the authentication system, allowing admins to manage staff accounts with passwords.
3.  **Verifying the UI/UX** of the User Management page for creating staff profiles and setting their passwords.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Reactivate the UserManagement page in  and verify its functionality for creating staff accounts.
